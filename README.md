Efficiently searching for relevant case studies is critical in architectural design, as designers rely on precedent examples to guide or inspire their ongoing projects. Traditional text-based search systems, while useful, struggle to capture the inherently visual and complex nature of architectural information. 

This paper introduces **ArchSeek🏠🔍**, an innovative case study search system with recommendation capability, tailored for architecture design professionals 📐. Leveraging vision-language models and cross-modal embeddings, ArchSeek enables domain-specific understandings of design cases, facilitating:
- Text search 💬 in natural language.
- Images search 🖼️ with fine-grained control.
- Case recommendations by *Liking design cases*❤️. 

It enhances personalization and efficiency, allowing architects to articulate preferences and discover design inspirations seamlessly.
